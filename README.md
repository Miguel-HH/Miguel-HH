## Hi üëã

I enjoy writing code for machines, and sometimes I also write stories for people.

I love watching how an interface is rendered. That moment when code stops being just an idea and becomes something tangible, something real that anyone can use, seems magical to me. I'm always on the lookout for opportunities to collaborate with other professionals at technology events. I have given talks on AI at universities and participated in blockchain and AI hackathons.

I studied civil engineering in 2010 and worked in that field until 2020. However, due to the pandemic, the peruvian state closed all construction sites, leaving me unemployed with a lot of free time. During that time, I started studying philosophy and programming. Since then, I have been very happy working as a developer.
