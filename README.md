# Hi 游녦

- I studied civil engineering back in 2010. But one day, I learned to code and decided to switch careers.
- I love it when someone uses an app I built and says "Wow! I didn't know this was possible."
- In 2022, I discovered ChatGPT, which inspired me to focus on AI projects as a full-stack developer.
